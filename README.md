# Dotfiles

All my dotfiles I use on a daily basis as an SRE. Configs are very minimal and pruned
from bloated dependencies to keep everything responsive.

You can feel free to use it but I won't provide any support nor documentation for it.


# Installation

Clone this repository anywhere:

```
git clone github.com/lucasclerissepro/.dotfiles ~/Documents/github.com/lucasclerissepro/.dotfiles
cd ~/Documents/github.com/lucasclerissepro/.dotfiles
```

Then install using `stow` and `make`:

```
make install
```

It will create all the symlink at the within the user root.
